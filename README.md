===============================

Welcome to my version of the Frogger game for the Udacity Project! 

Select the index.html to begin playing. 

The arrow keys on the keyboard will be used for movement around the grid. 

The objective of the game is to get across the road to the water without getting hit by the bugs.

If you get hit by the bugs, you will be sent back to your starting point!

Look out for the bugs, and thanks for viewing!
